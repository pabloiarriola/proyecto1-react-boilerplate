## Description 

In programming, the term boilerplate code refers to blocks of code used over and over again.

Letâ€™s assume your development stack consists of several libraries, such as React, Babel, Jest, Webpack, etc. 
When you start a new project, you initialize all these libraries and configure them to work with each other.

So here is where the boilerplate comes in. It is a template that you can clone and reuse for every project.
This one was made as a proyect for Web Development at UVG.  


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- link:https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm/ [NPM]   
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
    Clone repository with git clone <repo>
	or Download the zip file
```

```
    run command npm install inside root folder app: it will download all the dependencies required to run it

    npm run build : to build application before execute
    npm start     : to run application an initialize server in port 3000
```
This will launch the webpack-dev-server at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) there you will find a simple react app.

## Running the tests

```
    npm run test :this will help you test the build and check for errors
```

## Project Structure

- Boilerplate  
  - dist  
    - server.js 
	- public
		- index.html (entry point)  
		- client.js
  - node_modules (the dependencies needed)  
  - src (here is all the source code)
    - client
		- snapshots
		- history.js
		- index.html
		- index.js
	- containers
		- about
			- index.js
		- app
			- index.js
		- home
			- index.js
	- modules
		- counter.js (the demo app code)
		- index.js
	- server
		- index.js
		- web.server.js
		- web.server.test.js
	- enzyme.setup.js
	- store.js
	
  - .babelrc (babel configuration file)  
  - package.json (npm package list)  
  - webpack.config.js (webpack configuration file)  
  - README.md (what you are reading now)
